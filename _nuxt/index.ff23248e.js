Now I am studying the numerical optimization method in order to use in the optimal control for the robotics applicatons. Mostly, I implement all these optimization method through ROS which is know as Robotics Operating System. I am also studying Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Neural Network algorithms for applying in Robotics field and also use it with statistical analysis for the Data Science field. For the stacks of understanding, I have published a notebook about “House Prices Regression Advanced Technique” on Kaggle Platform <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/sokhengdin/house-prices-regression">House Price Regression Advanced Technique</a> .
